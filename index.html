        <h1>Who Am I</h1>
        <p class="intro">I'm Becca Williams, a former IT Specialist who is reskilling for a new yet related technology
            field.
            I'm a quiet, thoughtful woman and hope to be employed as a programmer sometime before March 2021 when I get
            married.</p>

            along with a large on-campus ministry known as Baptist Collegiate Ministries
            and spent most of my free time at my local church with members who became like a second family to me.

            <li>"One and one and one and one doesn't equal four. Each one remains unique, there is no way

            </li><br>
            <li>"They were nice enough people and all, but there wasn't much love in them. Because they were too
                busy
                being afraid.
                Love didn't grow very well in a place where there was only fear, just as plants didn't grow very
                well in
                a place
                where it was always dark."
